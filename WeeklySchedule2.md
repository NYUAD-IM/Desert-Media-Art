### Homework – Week 9.2

Due before start of next class
- **Finish** your Storyboard
- **Post** your Storyboard documentation to the class blog
- Your storyboard will be presented by a **different** group - make sure the story is clear to someone else from the storyboard alone

---

## Week 10.1
- Storyboard presentations and feedback
- Your storyboard will be presented by another group and then you will receive and respond to feedback
  - Usual format of 5-7 minutes presentation with 5-10 minutes of feedback


### Homework – Week 10.1

- **Work** on your Project Production

## Week 10.2
- NeoPixels
    - [NeoPixel Überguide (Adafruit)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/the-magic-of-neopixels)
    - [Powering NeoPixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/powering-neopixels)
    - [RP2040 Prop-Maker Power Management](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rp2040-prop-maker-feather/power-management)
      - The USB 5V or battery power is applied to the external screw terminal if you enable the power
    - [Circuit diagram | Halo Sword](https://learn.adafruit.com/halo-energy-sword-rp2040/circuit-diagram)
        - Shows how to connect NeoPixels powered by a direct LiPo battery
        - Make sure to wire the enable switch so you can switch off the power!
        
- Power considerations
    - [Watts vs Volts](https://au.rs-online.com/web/content/discovery/ideas-and-advice/difference-watts-vs-volts-guide)
    - Watt-hours is a measure of total energy
    - NeoPixels typically run at 5V
    - Each NeoPixel takes ~60mA at full brightness (RGB)
      - = .3W
      - So 1 meter of 30 LED/m NeoPixels could take 9.0W (max brightness)
    - A normal 5V USB-A port can supply up to 2A (5V x 2A = 10W)
        - ~30 pixels at full brightness 
    - So from a USB power bank you could power ~2m of 30led/m NeoPixels at 50% brightness
    - A normal PCB can take ~1A max
        - For >1m (30 LEDs) you should connect power more directly to strip
    - For the RP2040 Prop-Maker 2A is probably ok (designed to power NeoPixels)
   
- **Workshop** Project Production
- Work on projects in lab
- Consult on any problem areas

- References
  - [Sensor Plotting with Mu and CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/sensor-plotting-with-mu-and-circuitpython/capacitive-touch) - see raw touch sensor values

# Field Installation

## Sunday November 23

## Depart Welcome Center 1:30pm – Return 9:30pm (latest)

Students will go to a “raw” (uninhabited) dune location and make a temporary installation of their class projects. The students will have approximately 2 hours to work on site before sunset, and 1 hour after sunset. We’ll depart from campus in a bus that will park by the side of the road at the location and be our “base station” as we work in the dunes. In terms of logistics it’s similar to going out for a short film shoot in the desert.

For full details see [DMA Field Trips Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bEuE3UtrdrHOnXfWZGM35K8exFS7YfjfBcvRjt-y7Uw/edit?usp=drive_link)
