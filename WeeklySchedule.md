### Homework – Week 4.2

Due before start of next class

<!--
- **Finish soldering** your M4 Express board with long stacking headers
    - [Soldering Stacking Headers Tutorial](https://desert.nyuadim.com/2022/09/14/soldering-stacking-headers/)
-->

- **Solder** wires to your button
    - The button is non-polarized (it doesn't matter which wire we will hook up) so I suggest to use the *same colour* for both wires, and *not* black or red (reserve those for gnd / negative and power / positive)
- **Solder** wires to your speaker
    - The polarity of the connection to the speaker is only important if you have multiple speakers (for example in a home stereo) so suggest to make both wires the same colour or you could use black / red consistently for multiple speakers
- **Solder** wires to your NeoPixel ring and strip
    - Use red for 5V DC power
    - Use black for GND (ground)
    - Use another colour for Data Input
    - Leave Data Ouput open for now. Later we can use the Data Output to connect to the Data Input of another ring. 
    - You only need to solder wires to the strip / ring and then [use the screw terminals on the RP2040 Prop-Maker board](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rp2040-prop-maker-feather/prop-maker-example#wiring-3148148)
- Do *not* solder anything to your Prop-Maker board for now

- Run the [Prop-Maker example](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rp2040-prop-maker-feather/prop-maker-example) to test your work
    - Make sure to download the project bundle and copy the library and wav file to your board
    - Connect your components to the screw terminals on your Prop-Maker board using the small screwdrivers at the back of the IM Lab
    - The servo connects to the servo header (make sure to observe the polarity!)

<!--
        - Enable the external NeoPixel power and use ```EXTERNAL_NEOPIXELS``` to access the external NeoPixel strip
        - [Example code](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rp2040-prop-maker-feather/prop-maker-example#example-code-3148143)
     
```
# enable external power pin
# provides power to the external components
external_power = DigitalInOut(board.EXTERNAL_POWER)
external_power.direction = Direction.OUTPUT
external_power.value = True

# external neopixels
num_pixels = 30
pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.EXTERNAL_NEOPIXELS, num_pixels)
pixels.brightness = 0.3
rainbow = Rainbow(pixels, speed=0.05, period=2)
```

            - Example adapted for our board
 
To make your own .mp3, use the following settings:
- bit rate: anywhere from 16 to 320 kb/s (lower will be smaller, higher is better quality)
- sample rate: 22050Hz or 44100Hz are recommended, although 16kHz, 24kHz, and 48kHz should also work
- channels: mono or stereo
- must be DRM free
- *Recommended settings:* 22050Hz, 16kbps, Constant Bit Rate (CB), Mono
